# Recurrent Neural Networks
- cuda version: https://github.com/paperrune/RNN-cuda
- Support Batch Normalization and Dropout
- To classify MNIST handwritten digits, following files are required from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
  - train-images.idx3-ubyte
  - train-labels.idx1-ubyte
  - t10k-images.idx3-ubyte
  - t10k-labels.idx1-ubyte

- The network structure is determined by following variables in the main.cpp.

  ```C++
  91: char *type_layer[]  = {"MNIST", "Cbn,lstm", "Lce,sm"};
  94: int time_step       = 28;
  95: int map_width[]     = {1, 1, 1};
  96: int map_height[]    = {1, 1, 1};
  97: int number_maps[] Â  = {784 / length_train, 100, 10};
  ```  
  - The type is extended in [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://github.com/paperrune/Neural-Networks/tree/master/Convolutional_Neural_Networks), and only new types are shown on this page.

    "lstm" : long-short term memory
   
    > Regularization
    "bn"   : Batch Normalization (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.09025.pdf)
    "do.f" : Dropout with rate 0.f, each neurons is set to zero with a probability of (1 - 0.f)
